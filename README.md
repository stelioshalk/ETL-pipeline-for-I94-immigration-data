# ETL-pipeline-for-I94-immigration-data

# Project description
This project is to design a data lake ETL solution that automates data cleansing and processing the I-94 Immigration Dataset. Additionaly, the the Global Temperature Dataset and U.S. City Demographic Dataset are used. 

# The Data sets
## I-94 Dataset
For decades, U.S. immigration officers issued the I-94 Form (Arrival/Departure Record) to foreign visitors (e.g., business visitors, tourists and foreign students) who lawfully entered the United States. The I-94 was a small white paper form that a foreign visitor received from cabin crews on arrival flights and from U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the time of entry into the United States. It listed the traveler's immigration category, port of entry, data of entry into the United States, status expiration date and had a unique 11-digit identifying number assigned to it. Its purpose was to record the traveler's lawful admission to the United States.

## Global Temperature Dataset
The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study has created a preliminary merged data set by combining 1.6 billion temperature reports from 16 preexisting data archives.
The dataset is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data

## The US Cities: Demographics Dataset
This dataset contains information about the demographics of all US cities and census-designated places with a population greater or equal to 65,000. 
This data comes from the US Census Bureau's 2015 American Community Survey.
This product uses the Census Bureau Data API but is not endorsed or certified by the Census Bureau.
The dataset is available here: https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-cities-demographics/information/
 
## Airports Data
The airport codes may refer to either IATA airport code, a three-letter code which is used in passenger reservation, ticketing and baggage-handling systems, or the ICAO airport code which is a four letter code used by ATC systems and for airports that do not have an IATA airport code (from wikipedia).

Airport codes from around the world. Downloaded from public domain source http://ourairports.com/data/ who compiled this data from multiple different sources. This data is updated nightly.
The definition of the dataset is described here: https://ourairports.com/help/data-dictionary.html
